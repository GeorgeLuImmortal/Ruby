1) Get	5	regular	emails	and	5	advance-fee	fraud	emails	(aka	spam).		Save	them	as			
text	and	change	them	so	they	are	a		single,	long	string.			Then	turn	each	into	an	
array	of	words	(split may	help	here).		Then	use	a	bunch	of	regular	expressions	to	
search	the	array	of	words	looking	for	keywords	to	classify	which	files	are spam	
or	not.		If	you	want	to	get	fancy	you	could	give	each	array	a	spam-score	out	of	10.
2) Do	some	scraping	using	Nokogiri on	an	abitrarily	selected	web	page	from	
somewhere.
3) Take	a	fairly	complex		HTML document	and	parse	it	using Nokogiri.		 Draw	a	
picture	of	the	first	5	elements	showing	how	they	are	embedded	one	within	the	
other.			Take	a	photo	of the	picture	for	your	submitted	answer.
4) Define	your	own	class	that	illustrates	the	differences	between	public,	private	and	
protected	methods.	It	should	not	be anything	like	the	ones	I	did.
