1) Re-Visit the iTunes program and do the v.2 of it. Donâ€™t try to cut and paste what I have given you, work through the description I give of its properties and try to appreciate why these changes are being proposed and, if possible, improve on them yourself.
2) Define three classes, calling them something much more original than A, B and C; setthemupsothatCisasubclassofBandBisasubclassofA. Thendefinea bunch of attributes in A and about 3 methods and test their inheritance to instances of C. Define at least one additional method for B and C respectively and note how they do not apply up the hierarchy but they do apply down (if there is indeed a down).
