1) Use	ActiveRecord	to	set	up	a	database	with	a	number	of	records	in	it.		The	
database	should	contain	records	for	library	users	(with	fields	for	name,	age,	
books	borrowed)	and	library	books	(with	fields	for	borrower,	title,	borrowedwhen,
dueback).	Note,	it	should	be	set	up	so	that	a	borrower	can	borrow	many	
books.	Create	classes	for	these	objects	and	then	use	find to	print	out	the	
atributes	of	the	various	records	that	you	have	created.	
2) Do	something	really	smart	with	the	blocks	and	lambda	stuff	shown	in	the	notes.
