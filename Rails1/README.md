1) Go	back	to	the	hello	program	that	does the	mortgage	stuff	and	get	a	better	idea	
of	how	the	different	records	are	being	created	as	you	go	along.	Have	a	close	look	
att	the	methods	in	the	Other	Controller	(esp.	index,	change	and	quote)	and	
describe	how	they	are	interacting	with	the	database.		They	could	be	better,	no?		
So,	modify	each	method	to	make	it	interact	with	the	db	in	a	better	way.
2) Create	your	own	rails	app	that	has,	at	least,	3	separate	pages	and	3	controllers.		
Do	not	worry too	much about	layout,	but	just	get	each	page	to	do	something	
different and	design	it	so	that	you	can	move	from	one	page	to	the	next	by	
clicking	on	links.		
3) Finally,	is	it	possible	to	move	between	pages	without having	an	explicit	link	on	
which	a	user	clicks?		If	so,	how?
