1) In	the	SixDegrees	program,	the	find_films_by_actor method	is	fairly	crap.	If	you	
look	at	any	web-page	it	clearly	misses	loads	of	the	films	that	the	actor	is	in.	Your	
task	is	to	modify	it	to	find	more	films	(n.b.,	everything	it	finds	should	be	a	filmlink,
dealing	with	garbage	would	cause	too	many	problems	in	loading).
2) The	way	sixdegrees.rb	searches	through	the	space	of	actors	and	films	is	ok,	but	
probably	not	the	most	efficient.	Can	you	propose	two	modifications	to	the	
program	that	might	search	in	a	different	way.		Just	propose	the	algorithm,	you	
donâ€™t	have	to	implement	it.
